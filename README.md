# 🃏 Snap Card Game - Java Console Edition

A simple two-player console-based version of the classic card game Snap, built in Java.

When two consecutively dealt cards match in value, players must race to type "snap" within 2 seconds to win. The first player to do so correctly is declared the winner — but hesitate too long, and the chance is lost!


## ✨ Features

- Two-player alternating turns

- 🔀 Fully shuffled deck logic

- ⏳ Reaction-based SNAP logic with a 2-second timer

- Simple and readable CLI interface

- Modular code structure (Card, Deck, Player, CardGame, Snap)


## 🎮 How to Play

- Press Enter to deal a card on your turn.

- If the current card value matches the previous one, a SNAP opportunity is triggered.

- Each player is prompted in turn to type snap within 2 seconds.

- If the first player is too slow or types incorrectly, the second player gets a chance.

- If both players fail to snap correctly in time, the game continues.

- The game ends when a player wins by snapping correctly or when the deck runs out.
